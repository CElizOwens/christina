  <h2>Participation</h2>

<h4>Interested in performing?</h4>
<p>We encourage interested musicians to attend one of our free events and peruse the recordings here on our site for reference and insight into our vibe. Contact us at <a href="mailto:opusoakland@gmail.com">opusoakland@gmail.com</a> with your instrument(s) and any pieces (as well as the part you would like to play) that you have interest in performing. As a collective, we have the luxury of being able to bring together musicians of equal interest and enthusiasm for the various works and configurations of instrumentation that are proposed.</p><br>

<p>We ask that individuals, only, perform with us upon first playing an Opus Oakland event; however, we are open to welcoming complete ensembles with moderate performance experience to perform selected works from their own repertoire (to be determined on a group-by-group basis).</p>
