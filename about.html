<h2>About</h2>

	<p>Opus Oakland was created in October of 2017 by members of Oakland Civic Orchestra, a community orchestra affliated with Oakland Parks and Recreation.</p>

	<p>The goal of Opus is to provide a regular small ensemble performance opportunity where interested musicians can meet other chamber music enthusiasts and expand their repertoire. As a result, cafe-goers around Oakland get the benefit of receiving free mini-concerts of an ever-changing variety of classical genres with fellow friends and music lovers in a casual, intimate atmosphere.
	</p>
	
    <p>Chamber music is a passion of ours, and as non-professionals, amateurs and sometime-freelance giggers with "day" jobs, we merely enjoy having the outlet of bringing the unique charm and intimacy of a small string ensemble, a set of European folk tunes for accordion/violin duo, or perhaps the pleasantries of a flute quartet into the lives of any and all who'd like to listen.</p>
